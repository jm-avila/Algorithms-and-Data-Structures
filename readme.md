# Problem Solving Approach

## Understand the Problem

Before trying to solve it, understand it.

Ask youself these questions:

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data? What matters?

## Concrete example

Come up with concrete examples, to help you understand the problem better and help check that the eventual solution works properly.

- Simple examples (happy path)
- Complex examples (edge cases)
- Empty inputs examples
- Invalid inputs examples
