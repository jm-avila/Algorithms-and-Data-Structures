# Problem Solving Approach

## How do you improve?

### 1. Devise a plan for solving problems

#### Understand the Problem

Before trying to solve it, understand it.

Ask youself these questions:

- Can I restate the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs?
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data? What matters?

#### Concrete example

Come up with concrete examples, to help you understand the problem better and help check that the eventual solution works properly.

- Simple examples (happy path)
- Complex examples (edge cases)
- Empty inputs examples
- Invalid inputs examples

#### Break it down

Explicitly write down the steps you need to take.

This will help you:

- Think about the code you'll write before you write it.
- Catch conceptual issues or misunderstandings.

#### Solve or Simplify

Solve the problem, if you can't, find the core difficulty and temporarily ignore it. Write a simplified solution and then incorporate the difficulty and reiterate.

#### Refactor

Refactoring questions:

- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Is the implementation easily understood?
- Can you improve the perfomance?
- Have others solved the problem before?
- Can you use the implementation for another problem?

### 2. Common problem solving patterns

#### Frequency Counter

Using objects or sets to collect values or frequencies of values.

This can often avoid nested loops or O(n^2) operations withs arrays and strings.

#### Multiple Pointers

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and then move towards the beginning, end or middle, based on a certain condition.

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity.

#### Sliding Window

Creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window will increase or decrease and a new window created.

Usefull for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string.

#### Divide and Conquer

Dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subtset of data.

Usefull to decrease time complexity.

### 3. Recursion

#### What is recursion?

A process that calls itself.

#### How do recursive functions work?

Define a named function that calls itself with a different input on each call, until it reaches the base case.

#### Base Case

The condition that ends the recursion.

#### Recursive function essentials

- Base Case
- Different Input
- Returning values from a function to another to get data from each function call.
- Pure recursion: avoid mutating inputs, opt for making copies.
- Helper method recursion: use the external scope to mutate elements withoud having to return from each call.

### 4. Searching Algorithms

#### What is a search algorithm?

An algorithm used to retrieve information stored within some data structure either with discrete or continuous values.

#### Common JS array search methods

- indexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

#### Linear Search

Given an array and a value. Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value. Basically it's looking element by element until you find the value.

- Appropriate for unordered lists.
- On average has a Big O of O(n).

#### Binary Search

Given a sorted array and a value, rather than looping in a order fashion, we start form the middle of the array and evaluate whether the value is at the right or left of the current position. We then do the same with the subset of data where the value would be, given the sort order.

- Appropriate for ordered lists.
- On average has a Big O of O(log n).

### 5. Sort Algorithms

#### What is sorting?

The process of rearranging the items in a collection so the items are in some kind of order.

#### JS sort built-in method

[].sort()

The method accepts an optional comparator function, that looks at pairs of elements and determines their sort order based on the return value.
example:

```javascript
[1, 2, 10, 20].sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

If the return value is:

- a negative number, a should come before b.
- a positive number, a should come after b.
- 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned.

#### Sorting Algorithms Animations

Animations that illustrate how effectively data sets from different starting points can be sorted using different algorithms. See the [website](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).

#### Basic Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

#### Bubble Sort

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!

#### Selection Sort

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.

#### Insertion Sort

Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.

#### Shortcomings of Basic Sorting Algorithms

    - Don't scale well
    - As the input size increases, the time it takes to sort the values increases proportionally.

#### Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

#### Why use these Algorithms?

- Faster Sorts
- With respect with the basic ones, improves time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n).

#### Merge Sort

It's a combination of splitting, merging and sorting. Exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.

Spit:
Split an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements.

Merge:

Given two arrays which are sorted, create a new array which is also sorted and consists of all the elements in the two input arrays.

The merge should run on O(n + m) time and space, and should not modify the inputs.

Sort:

Compare the elements in both array and order them until any of the two arrays has no elements. If any of the arrays has more elements than can be compared, those elements are already sorted.

#### Quick Sort

Is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

#### Radix Sort
